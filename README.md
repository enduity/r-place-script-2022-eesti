## About

This is a script to help draw r/Eesti imagery to r/place.

## Features

- Support for multiple accounts
- Determines the cooldown time remaining for each account
- Detects existing matching pixels on the r/place map and skips them
- Automatically converts colors to the r/place color palette
- Automatically pulls the most recent r/Eesti jpg from a central server

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [A Reddit App Client ID and App Secret Key](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)

## How to Get App Client ID and App Secret Key

You need to generate an app client id and app secret key for each account in order to use this script.

Steps:

1. Visit <https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps>
2. Click "create (another) app" button at very bottom
3. Select the "script" option and fill in the fields with anything

If you don't want to create a development app for each account, you can add each username as a developer in the developer app settings. You will need to duplicate the client ID and secret in .env, though.

## Python Package Requirements

Install requirements from 'requirements.txt' file.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Get Started

Create a file called '.env'

Put in the following content:

```text
ENV_PLACE_USERNAME='["developer_username"]'
ENV_PLACE_PASSWORD='["developer_password"]'
ENV_PLACE_APP_CLIENT_ID='["app_client_id"]'
ENV_PLACE_SECRET_KEY='["app_secret_key"]'
```

- ENV_PLACE_USERNAME is an array of usernames of developer accounts
- ENV_PLACE_PASSWORD is an array of the passwords of developer accounts
- ENV_PLACE_APP_CLIENT_ID is an array of the client ids for the app / script registered with Reddit
- ENV_PLACE_SECRET_KEY is an array of the secret keys for the app / script registered with Reddit


## Run the Script

```python
python3 main.py
```

## Multiple Workers

If you want two threads drawing the image at once you could have a setup like this:

```text
ENV_PLACE_USERNAME='["developer_username_1", "developer_username_2"]'
ENV_PLACE_PASSWORD='["developer_password_1", "developer_password_2"]'
ENV_PLACE_APP_CLIENT_ID='["app_client_id_1", "app_client_id_2"]'
ENV_PLACE_SECRET_KEY='["app_secret_key_1", "app_secret_key_2"]'
```

The same pattern can be used for multiple drawing at once. Note that the "ENV_PLACE_USERNAME", "ENV_PLACE_PASSWORD", "ENV_PLACE_APP_CLIENT_ID", "ENV_PLACE_SECRET_KEY" variables MUST be string arrays of the same size.

## Thread start delay

If you want threads to start at a delay, add another variable (in seconds):

```text
ENV_THREAD_DELAY='15'
```

If you'd like, you can enable Verbose Mode by editing the Python file. This will output a lot more information, and not neccessarily in the right order, but it is useful for development and debugging.
